This scheduler is usually used to perform UI work.

Main scheduler is a specialization of `SerialDispatchQueueScheduler`.

This scheduler is optimized for `observeOn` operator. To ensure observable sequence is subscribed on main thread using `subscribeOn`
operator please use `ConcurrentMainScheduler` because it is more optimized for that purpose.
